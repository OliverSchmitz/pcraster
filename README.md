# PCRaster
Environmental modelling software

PCRaster is a collection of tools and software libraries tailored to the construction of spatio-temporal environmental models. Application domains are amongst others hydrology (rainfall-runoff, global water balance, groundwater (with Modflow)), ecology, or land use change. Two scripting languages (Python and PCRcalc) include a rich set of spatial operations for manipulating and analysing raster maps. A Python framework supports Monte Carlo simulations and data assimilation (Ensemble Kalman Filter and Particle Filter). The Aguila tool allows for the interactive visualisation of stochastic spatio-temporal data.

You can find more information about our research and development projects on [our website.](http://computationalgeography.org/) Information on PCRaster is given at the [project website](http://www.pcraster.eu/), and online documentation can be found [here](https://pcraster.geo.uu.nl/pcraster/latest/documentation/index.html). For questions regarding the usage of PCRaster please use our [mailing list](https://lists.geo.uu.nl/mailman/listinfo/pcraster-info), bugs can be reported via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/pcraster/pcraster/issues).
